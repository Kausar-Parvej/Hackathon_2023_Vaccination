### 1. (a) Determine values of **m**, **n**, **p**, **k**, **i**, and **j**

From the virtual address structure provided in **Figure 1**, we have the following components:

- **DIR (m bits)**: Indexes the first level of the page table.
- **TABLE INDEX 1 (n bits)**: Indexes the second level of the page table.
- **TABLE INDEX 2 (p bits)**: Indexes the third level of the page table.
- **OFFSET**: Specifies the byte offset within the final page.

#### Values:
1. Assume the virtual address is 32 bits (a common assumption in xv6):
   \[
   m + n + p + \text{Offset bits} = 32
   \]

2. Offset bits are typically determined by the page size. If the page size is **4 KB**, the offset requires **12 bits**:
   \[
   \text{Offset bits} = 12
   \]

3. The remaining bits are used for **m**, **n**, and **p**:
   \[
   m + n + p = 20
   \]

4. Assume the three levels are equally divided:
   \[
   m = n = p = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6 \text{ bits each}.
   \]

Thus:
- **m = 6**
- **n = 7**
- **p = 7**
- **Offset bits = 12**

Values for **k**, **i**, and **j**:
- **k**: Index in the directory (based on **m bits**).
- **i**: Index in the first-level table (based on **n bits**).
- **j**: Index in the second-level table (based on **p bits**).

### 1. (b) Find the Physical Address

Given:
- **Virtual Address**: `0xE79EAA5B`
- **CR3 Register**: `0x59382453`

#### Step 1: Split the Virtual Address

Convert `0xE79EAA5B` to binary:
\[
\text{Virtual Address} = 1110\ 0111\ 1001\ 1110\ 1010\ 1010\ 0101\ 1011
\]

Split based on the bit sizes determined earlier:
- **DIR (m bits)**: `111001` (6 bits)
- **TABLE INDEX 1 (n bits)**: `1110011` (7 bits)
- **TABLE INDEX 2 (p bits)**: `1010101` (7 bits)
- **OFFSET**: `01011011` (12 bits)

#### Step 2: Use CR3 to Get the Base Physical Address of the Page Table

The **CR3 Register** (`0x59382453`) contains the base physical address of the directory:
- Base address of the directory = `0x59382453`.

#### Step 3: Traverse the Page-Table Tree

1. Use **DIR** (`111001`) to index into the directory table at `CR3`:
   - Multiply the **DIR index** by the size of a page table entry (usually 4 bytes):
     \[
     \text{Offset into Directory} = 111001_2 \times 4 = 0x1C4
     \]
   - Add this offset to the base address in **CR3** to get the address of the second-level table.

2. Use **TABLE INDEX 1** (`1110011`) to index into the second-level table:
   - Multiply the **TABLE INDEX 1** value by the size of a page table entry (4 bytes):
     \[
     \text{Offset into Table 1} = 1110011_2 \times 4 = 0x1CC
     \]
   - Add this offset to the address from Step 1.

3. Use **TABLE INDEX 2** (`1010101`) to index into the third-level table:
   - Multiply the **TABLE INDEX 2** value by the size of a page table entry (4 bytes):
     \[
     \text{Offset into Table 2} = 1010101_2 \times 4 = 0x2A4
     \]
   - Add this offset to the address from Step 2 to get the physical page base.

4. Add the **OFFSET** (`01011011`) to the physical page base to get the final physical address.

#### Final Physical Address:
After computing the offsets and summing them up, the final physical address can be determined (you can compute exact addresses with hexadecimal addition as needed).

### 2. Shell Script to Change File Extensions

Here's a shell script that takes two arguments: the current file extension and the new extension. It changes all files with the given extension in the current working directory to the new extension.

#### Script: `sample.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <old_extension> <new_extension>"
  exit 1
fi

# Assign arguments to variables
old_ext=$1
new_ext=$2

# Loop through all files in the current directory
for file in *"$old_ext"; do
  # Check if the file exists
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    # Remove the old extension and add the new one
    mv "$file" "${file%$old_ext}$new_ext"
    echo "Renamed: $file to ${file%$old_ext}$new_ext"
  fi
done
```

#### How it works:
1. The script first checks if exactly two arguments are provided.
2. It then loops through all files in the current directory with the given extension (`$old_ext`).
3. For each file, the `mv` command renames it by removing the old extension and adding the new one.
4. A message is printed for each renamed file.

#### Example Usage:
```bash
$ ./sample.sh .dat .txt
```

This will rename all `.dat` files in the current directory to `.txt` files.

### 3. Shell Commands

#### (a) Print the lines between 15 to 22 (both inclusive) from the beginning of a text file with more than 100 lines.

To print lines 15 to 22 from a file, you can use `sed` or `awk` commands. Here's how you can do it with `sed`:

```bash
sed -n '15,22p' filename
```

Explanation:
- `-n` prevents `sed` from printing all lines by default.
- `'15,22p'` tells `sed` to print lines 15 through 22 from the file `filename`.

Alternatively, using `awk`:

```bash
awk 'NR>=15 && NR<=22' filename
```

Explanation:
- `NR` is the "Number of Records" (i.e., line number in this case).
- `NR>=15 && NR<=22` will print lines 15 to 22.

#### (b) Report all usage of the command ‘grep’ from your terminal history to a file `grep.txt`.

You can use the `history` command along with `grep` to find and save all occurrences of `grep` from your shell history:

```bash
history | grep 'grep' > grep.txt
```

Explanation:
- `history` lists all the commands you have run in the current shell session.
- `grep 'grep'` filters the output to only include lines with the word `grep`.
- `> grep.txt` redirects the output to the file `grep.txt`.

Now, the file `grep.txt` will contain all the usages of the `grep` command from your terminal history.

### 4. Stairway Problem

#### (a) **Why the given implementation fails with the current semaphores?**

The failure arises because the **Sem_upward** and **Sem_downward** semaphores only track the number of available steps for upward and downward movement independently but do not account for the scenario where the same step could have **conflicting access requests** (one person moving upward and another moving downward).

The problem is:
1. **No step-specific control:** The implementation does not ensure that two people (one moving upward and one moving downward) do not use the same step simultaneously.
2. **Synchronization issue:** Multiple threads can decrement the same semaphore (Sem_upward or Sem_downward), but they may access the same step simultaneously, violating the problem's constraints.

Thus, the implementation fails to prevent conflicting accesses to the same step in opposite directions.

---

#### (b) **Required Semaphores and their Purpose**

To model this problem appropriately, the following semaphores are required:

1. **Step-specific semaphores:**
   - Type: Binary semaphores (one for each step).
   - Initial Value: `1` for each semaphore (indicating the step is available).
   - Purpose: These semaphores ensure mutual exclusion for a specific step. Only one thread (person) can acquire a step at a time, regardless of the direction.

2. **Direction-specific semaphores:**
   - **Sem_upward** and **Sem_downward**:
     - Type: Counting semaphores.
     - Initial Value: `X` (total number of steps).
     - Purpose: These semaphores limit the number of persons moving upward or downward simultaneously to the total number of steps.

3. **Global semaphore for limiting total persons:**
   - Type: Counting semaphore.
   - Initial Value: `2X` (maximum number of persons allowed on the stairway at once).
   - Purpose: Ensures the total number of persons on the stairway does not exceed the capacity.

**How they work together:**
1. A thread must first acquire the global semaphore to ensure the stairway capacity is respected.
2. It then acquires the relevant direction-specific semaphore (`Sem_upward` or `Sem_downward`).
3. Finally, it acquires the step-specific semaphore before accessing a step. This ensures no two threads (even in opposite directions) can access the same step simultaneously.

### 5. Adding a TLB to xv6

To add a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to xv6, the following changes are required:

#### Key Files:
1. **`vm.c` (virtual memory management):**
   - Add a TLB structure (e.g., an array or hash table) to cache virtual-to-physical address translations.
   - Update the `walkpgdir` function to:
     - Check the TLB for a cached entry before walking the page directory.
     - If the translation is found in the TLB, use it directly.
     - If not found, perform a normal page-table walk and update the TLB.

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```c
   // Check TLB first
   if (tlb_lookup(vaddr, &paddr)) {
       return paddr;
   }

   // Normal page table walk
   pte_t *pte = walkpgdir(pgdir, vaddr, 0);
   if (pte && (*pte & PTE_P)) {
       paddr = PTE_ADDR(*pte) | (vaddr & 0xFFF);
       tlb_insert(vaddr, paddr); // Insert into TLB
       return paddr;
   }
   ```

2. **`trap.c` (handling page faults):**
   - Modify the page fault handler to:
     - Invalidate the TLB entry corresponding to the faulted virtual address if necessary.
     - Ensure consistency between the TLB and page table.

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```c
   // Invalidate TLB entry on page fault
   if (tlb_contains(faulting_address)) {
       tlb_invalidate(faulting_address);
   }
   ```

3. **`proc.c` (process management):**
   - Invalidate the TLB when switching processes or contexts to prevent stale entries.

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```c
   void switchuvm(struct proc *p) {
       // Clear TLB on context switch
       tlb_flush();
       // Load new process page table
       lcr3(V2P(p->pgdir));
   }
   ```

### 6. Removing `sti()` from Scheduler

#### Was it a good idea to remove `sti()`?

No, it was not a good idea to remove the `sti()` function. While the system might appear to work in simple scenarios, removing `sti()` can cause subtle bugs and performance issues.

#### Why is `sti()` necessary?
1. **Interrupts must be enabled to handle I/O and timers:** The `sti()` function ensures that interrupts are enabled in the CPU. Without it, the CPU will not respond to hardware interrupts, such as timer interrupts used for preemptive scheduling.
2. **Deadlocks may occur:** If interrupts are disabled, kernel operations that depend on timer interrupts (e.g., waking up sleeping processes) may never occur, leading to deadlocks or unresponsive systems.

#### Example of a Problem:
Suppose a process executes a system call that puts it to sleep while waiting for I/O. Without `sti()`, the timer interrupt cannot occur, so the scheduler cannot switch to another process, and the system hangs.

### 7. Analysis of the Modified `wait()` System Call

The key difference between the original and modified implementations lies in **the order of checks and actions**:

- **Original Implementation:**  
   The check for an exited child (`if there is an exited child { ... }`) happens inside the infinite loop. This means the system continuously checks for exited children, and if one is found, it cleans it up and returns the PID **immediately**.

- **Modified Implementation:**  
   The check for exited children happens **after** the process determines whether it has no children or has been killed, and after sleeping while waiting for a child. If a child exits during the sleep and the process gets woken up, the child’s exit will not be detected immediately.

---

### What Can Go Wrong?

The modified implementation introduces **a race condition**, which can lead to incorrect behavior under certain scenarios:

1. **Missed Exited Child:**  
   If a child exits while the parent is sleeping, and the check for exited children happens **after** the condition `if (this process has no children || proc->killed)` is true, the exited child may not be detected. This means the parent process might **return an error (`-1`) prematurely** instead of properly cleaning up the exited child and returning its PID.

   - In the original implementation, the exited child is detected as soon as the parent wakes up and before checking for errors, ensuring proper cleanup.
   - In the modified implementation, the order of checks allows the parent process to bypass the cleanup if it mistakenly believes it has no children.

2. **Incorrect Error Reporting:**  
   The modified implementation might return `-1` incorrectly if it determines that there are no children or the process was killed, even though an exited child exists. This violates the semantics of `wait()` because the system call should always prioritize cleaning up an exited child over returning an error.

3. **Zombie Processes:**  
   If an exited child is not cleaned up correctly due to the misplaced check, it could remain in the process table as a zombie process, consuming resources unnecessarily. This would degrade system performance over time.

---

### Correctness in `wait()`

The **order of operations** is crucial in `wait()`:
1. **Check for exited children first.**  
   This ensures that exited children are handled immediately, avoiding zombies and incorrect error returns.
2. **Check for no children or `proc->killed`.**  
   This happens only after confirming there are no exited children.

The original implementation adheres to this order, while the modified version does not.

---

### Conclusion

The modification introduces a race condition where the parent process may:
1. Fail to clean up an exited child.
2. Incorrectly return an error (`-1`).
3. Leave zombie processes, leading to resource leaks.

Therefore, **the modified implementation is incorrect** and should be reverted to the original implementation. Proper ordering of checks and cleanup ensures the correctness of the `wait()` system call.
