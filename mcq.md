### 1. The correct answer to this question is:

**(d) It would read only file 3**

### Explanation:
In a shell script, the `exec < filename` command is used to redirect the input for the shell script (or process) from the specified file. The redirection applies to the shell or script until the end of the script or the redirection is explicitly changed.

The sequence of commands in the question is as follows:
```bash
exec < file1
exec < file2
exec < file3
read line
```

- The first `exec < file1` redirects the input to `file1`.
- The second `exec < file2` changes the input redirection to `file2`, so now the input comes from `file2` instead of `file1`.
- The third `exec < file3` changes the input redirection again, this time to `file3`.

After these redirections, the `read line` statement reads from `file3` because it was the last file specified in the redirection commands.

So, **only file 3** will be used as the source for the `read` command, making **(d)** the correct answer.

### **2. What is the output of the following code?**
```bash
os=linux
echo 1.$os 2."$os" 3.'$os' 4.os
```

**Answer:** (c) **1.linux 2.linux 3.$os 4.os**

### Explanation:
1. **1.$os**: This uses **variable substitution** to print the value of `os`, which is `linux`. The output is `1.linux`.
2. **2."$os"**: This also uses **variable substitution** within double quotes. It will expand the variable `os` to `linux`, so the output is `2.linux`.
3. **3.'$os'**: This uses **single quotes**, which prevent variable expansion. Therefore, it literally prints `$os` instead of its value, so the output is `3.$os`.
4. **4.os**: This prints the string `os` as it is, so the output is `4.os`.

Therefore, the output is `1.linux 2.linux 3.$os 4.os`.

### **3. Which of the following APIs can be used for synchronization between threads?**
**Answer:** (c) **pthread_join**

### Explanation:
- **`pthread_join`** is used for synchronizing threads. It ensures that one thread waits for another thread to finish executing before continuing. This is commonly used for synchronization between threads in a multithreaded program.
- **`pthread_exit`**: Terminates a thread.
- **`pthread_cancel`**: Attempts to cancel a thread.
- **`pthread_self`**: Returns the ID of the calling thread.

### **4. To ensure difficulties do not arise in the original readersâ€“writers problem, ______ are given exclusive access to the shared object.**
**Answer:** (b) **writers**

### Explanation:
In the **readers-writers problem**, to avoid conflicts and ensure data consistency, **writers** are given **exclusive access** to the shared object, meaning no readers or other writers can access the resource while a writer is writing to it.

- **Readers** can access the shared resource simultaneously as long as no writer is writing.
- **Writers** require exclusive access to avoid interference with readers, which could result in inconsistent data.

### **5. Carefully look at the following POSIX C code snippet:**
The code snippet involves memory mapping and access to shared memory. The question asks for the number of page faults that will occur based on the FIFO page-replacement policy with a maximum of 4 pages in memory.

```c
int fl = open("xv6-mm-easy-prob.dat");
char *ptr = (char *)mmap(0, 131072, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED);
uint sum = 0;
for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 8192; i++) {
        sum += ptr[i];
    }
}
uint val1 = 0;
uint val2 = 0;
for (int j = 20472; j <= 45056; k++) {
    sum += ptr[i];
    val1 = ptr[1];
    val2 = ptr[45150];
}
printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", sum, val1, val2);
```

**Answer:** (b) **9**

### Explanation:
This code involves memory mapping a file and then accessing the mapped memory in a loop. The FIFO page-replacement policy works by loading pages into memory until the memory limit is reached (4 pages in this case). Once the limit is exceeded, older pages are replaced by newer ones.

- **The mmap size is 131072 bytes** (128 KB), and since each page is typically 4096 bytes (4 KB), this implies that 131072 / 4096 = **32 pages** are required to map the entire file.
- **Maximum of 4 pages** can be held in memory, so the system will experience **multiple page faults** as it accesses different parts of the memory, particularly because the loop accesses different sections of the file.
- Given that there are 32 pages in total and only 4 can be held in memory at any time, the **number of page faults** will be **9**.

This calculation assumes the page replacement policy is FIFO, and as pages are accessed in sequence, older pages will be swapped out, causing additional page faults.

Here are the answers to the questions about the **xv6** operating system:

**6. In which case `panic()` function is called in xv6?**
   - **Answer:** (c) Kernel bug  
   **Explanation:** The `panic()` function in xv6 is typically called when there is an unexpected condition that cannot be recovered from, usually due to a kernel bug or serious error. It halts the system with an error message.
   
**7. Which of the following is false in xv6?**
   - **Answer:** (c) All the pages of a process are allocated  
   **Explanation:** In xv6, when a process is created, not all pages are allocated immediately. Pages are allocated as needed (e.g., through demand paging). Options (a) and (b) are true: `PTXSHIFT` is 12 (as it is a 4KB page size) and each process does have a separate page directory.

**8. When is `trapret` run?**
   - **Answer:** (d) During allocating new process; after `forkret`  
   **Explanation:** `trapret` is run during the context switch after the new process is created. Specifically, it's called during the process setup, after `forkret` has completed the setup of the new process context. It is used to return from a trap and resume execution of the user process.
